//S***Welcome to Arctic Fox!
//***Since t_his is the first tutorial, we first present some useful information about the 
//***look and setup of the tutorials. Please read the information below, and then proceed
//***to Step 2. 



//S***Activating Arctic Fox
//***If you have not yet activated Arctic Fox, you must do so before Arctic Fox can run. Also,
//***if you haven't activated Arctic Fox, all of the Special Formatting won't be here!! 

//***Click the Arctic Fox logo on the left vertical bar. This will open the Arctic Fox pane on
//***the left side of the screen. Enter your email and password and click the Activate button. 

//***If you have not created an Arctic Fox account, visit the "here" link in the Arctic Fox
//***pane and create and account. Because Arctic Fox is in alpha, after an account is created,
//***Icii must approve the account. Please give Icii 24 hours to approve any new accounts.  



//S***Special Formatting
//***Arctic Fox embeds special formatting into Verilog code. This formatting is designed to
//***make it more clear what is code, and what isn't. For example, the italic grey text you
//***are reading is simply a comment whose line starts with //*** . Don't worry, any text
//***with special formatting is a comment and will not impact your code.

//***Additionally, in our tutorials, sections with start with a section header, as seen above.
//***Section headers are underlined. Continuing on.



//S***Steps
//***Another piece of information for the tutorials, each Step of a tutorial may have substeps, 
//***such as a, b, c, etc. The steps will be highlighted green, as you can see in the step below.
//***To move to the next step in a tutorial, click the Arctic Fox icon on the vertical bar on the
//***left. In the Tutorials area, click the drop down, and select the step you want to advance to.
//***Once selected, the text below the drop down will describe the step. Click the Switch button 
//***to move to that step in the tutorial.

//***When you move to a new step in the tutorial, your progress for the current step will be 
//***saved before moving to the new step. In the new step, you will be able to see the correct
//***result for all previous steps. Please note, no generated code will be present at first. To
//***see the results of any code generation, you will first need to run Arcitc Fox.
